title: "Assignment 1: Project Proposal"

**Due: Wednesday, Jan 29th by 11:59 PM**

This is a **Team** assignment.

Project Proposal
================

Your main task this semester is to complete a semester-long team software project. Your task in this assignment is to form your team and decide what your project will be.

In a 2-3 page document, describe the following:

**Who are your team members?** You must have at least 2 but not more than 4.

**Briefly describe the system your team will create.** Please note the following important requirements:

1.  The system must be a web application, meaning that the user interface must be web-based.
2.  The system must include at least one *web service*. A web service is an interface to a web application that is used by programs rather than human users.
3.  The system must store persistent data in a database.
4.  The system must be awesome when it is completed.

*Be ambitious*. The goal of this course is to learn how to design and build complex software. I do not expect that you will necessarily complete 100% of what you propose.

In your description of the system, include sketches of what the user interface will look like. Also include some ideas about how you will include a web service in your system. One common type of web service that web applications support is exporting data in a format allowing it to be imported into other applications. For example, if you are developing an inventory-tracking system, you could implement a web service that exported inventory information in CSV format.

**What language(s) and programming environment will you use?** My strong recommendation is to use Java and Eclipse: you can use the [Google Web Toolkit](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) to create rich web-based user interfaces using Java. Note that you can create 2D graphics, including animations, using GWT.

*Please note*: if you choose a language and/or environment other than the recommended one, it is *your* responsibility to know it well enough to make progress on your project and to resolve any technical issues you encounter.
