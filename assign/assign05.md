# Team Project Milestones

This document specifies the project milestones.

The team project milestones are as follows:

> Date | Milestone
> ---- | ---------
> Fri, Mar 28th | Demo: Model classes working and tested
> Fri, Apr 4th | Demo: Minimal working system (with initial UI)
> Fri, Apr 11th | Demo: More features
> Fri, Apr 25th | Demo: 50% working system
> Fri, May 2nd | Demo: Database fully integrated
> Wed, May 7th | Demo: Readiness for final presentation

## Additional details

*Model classes working and tested*: All of the important model classes for your system should be working, and should have a relatively complete set of unit tests.

*Minimal working system (with initial UI)*: Your system should be minimally usable, meaning that it has a UI, and at least partially implements one or more of your use cases.

*More features*: More features should be working and available through your UI.

*50% working system*: The system should implement 50% of the use cases.

*Database fully integrated*: Your should have a working implementation of your persistence interface that uses a database rather than in-memory data structures.  Note that you should also be making progress on your requirements.

*Readiness for final presentation*: The system should be ready to demo as part of your final project presentation.

## Grading

For each of these milestones, I will give your team one of the following grades: *below expectations*, *meets expectations*, or *exceeds expectations*.  *Below expectations* means that I am concerned that your team is not making sufficient progress.
