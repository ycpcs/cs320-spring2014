# Individual Project Milestones

This document specifies the milestones for your individual project.

The individual project milestones are as follows:

> Date | Milestone
> ---- | ---------
> Wed, April 16 | Baseline
> Wed, May 1st | Progress update 

## Additional details

*Baseline*: You should demonstrate a reasonable start on your project.  Specifically, you should show some working code using the language or platform you are investigating for your application.

*Progress update*: You should demonstrate reasonable progress relative to the baseline demonstration.  At least some of the functionality you outlined in your [proposal](assign02.html) should be working.

## Grading

For each of these milestones, I will assign one of the following grades: *below expectations*, *meets expectations*, or *exceeds expectations*.  *Below expectations* means that I am concerned that you are not making sufficient progress.
