**Due: Friday, May 9th by 11:59 PM**

This is an **individual** project

# Individual Project Deliverables

There are three deliverables for your individual project (which you proposed in [Assignment 2](assign02.html)).

## Journal

As you work on your individual project, keep a journal of your work.

Each journal entry should document

* What problem you were trying to solve
* What challenges you encountered
* What sources of information you used (cite these specifically; include URLs for web resources)
* What you did to solve the problem

Each entry can be brief, but should include all of the information described above.

## Report

Submit a *short* (1-2 page) report describing *what you learned* from the experience of working on the project.  Some things you might address include:

* What was the most frustrating aspect of the project?
* What was the most satisfying aspect of the project?
* What did you learn that you could apply to future projects?

## Code

Submit the code you developed for the project.

# Submitting

Submit the journal and report to Marmoset as **assign09journal** and **assign09report**, respectively.  Use *only* plain text of PDF: do *not* upload a Microsoft Word or rich text document.

<div class="callout">
Your report and journal <em>must</em> be submitted in plain text or PDF format.  Submissions in any other format may receive a grade of 0.
</div>


Submit the code in a zip file to Marmoset as **assign09code**.  (Please submit a zip file: not a RAR file or any other archive format.)
