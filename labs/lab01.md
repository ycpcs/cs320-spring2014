title: "Lab 1: Using Git"
---

In this lab, you will practice using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), which is currently the most widely used and arguably the best version control system.

In this course, we will mostly be using [EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/), which is the Git client software built into Eclipse.  This lab will familiarize you with using EGit.

## Before you start

Be aware of the following fact:

<div class="callout">
Git has a bit of a learning curve.
</div>

As with most worthwhile skills, becoming proficient with Git takes some work.  The best advice is to *think carefully* about what you're doing.

Another thing to keep in mind:

<div class="callout">
Git is one of the most awesome and powerful software development tools ever created.
</div>

Like OO Analysis, being able to use Git is a software development super power.

## Step 0: Create an ssh keypair

## Step 1: Fork

Log into [GitHub](https://github.com) using your GitHub account.

Go to the following GitHub repository page:

  [https://github.com/daveho/MoveTheSquare](https://github.com/daveho/MoveTheSquare)

Click the **Fork** button.  This will make a clone of this repository in your own GitHub account.  This will be your public repository for this lab.

The repository you just forked contains an Eclipse project called **MoveTheSquare**, a game engine that will be the basis for the next great indie game.  You will just need to add some additional gameplay features!

## Step 2: Clone

Next, clone your fork as follows:

1. Copy the *SSH* clone URL from the repository page for your fork.
2. Start Eclipse.  Choose **File &rarr; Import... &rarr; Git &rarr; Projects from Git**.
3. TODO
