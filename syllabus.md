========================================

*Note: preliminary syllabus, not official*

**Spring 2014**

Instructor:

-   [David Hovemeyer](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/), <dhovemey@ycp.edu>, KEC 113 \<br /\> Office hours: TBD

Course Description
------------------

This course describes the software development process in detail, including the software life cycle and models of software development; requirements analysis and software design techniques, such as SADT and Jackson Design Methodology; techniques for software quality assurance, including design reviews, testing, metrics, and an introduction to program verification; and software project planning, organization, and management. Students will be expected to participate in a team-programming project.

Prerequisites
-------------

CS 201 with a grade of 2 or higher

Textbook
--------

Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres, [Extreme Programming Explained](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321278658), 2nd ed.

Martin Fowler, [UML Distilled](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321193687), 3rd ed.

Brett D. McLaughlin, Gary Pollice, and David West, [Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design](http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfooad/)

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

The overall goals of this course are to explore the issues surrounding "real world" software development, and to learn how to work effectively with the people involved in a software project.

The course will heavily emphasize discussion and participation. As such, I expect you to attend class and participate fully in the in-class activities. Repeated absences or failure to participate will negatively affect your grade.

Throughout the semester, you will be working in a team to design and implement a substantial software system. This project will allow you to apply the concepts you are learning about in the readings and the in-class activities.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

-   Collect software requirements and develop use cases
-   Develop analysis and design models
-   Critique analysis and design models to suggest possible improvements
-   Use analysis/design models to guide implementation
-   Assess and ensure software quality using unit tests, system tests, metrics, and static analysis
-   Understand the software lifecycle
-   Understand the issues involved in planning and estimation for a software project

Policies
--------

### Grades

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> Numeric Range | Letter Grade
> ------------- | ------------
> 90-100        | A (4.0)
> 85-90         | B+ (3.5)
> 80-85         | B (3.0)
> 75-80         | C+ (2.5)
> 70-75         | C (2.0)
> 60-70         | D (1.0)
> 0-60          | F (0.0)

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

-   Individual assignments: 15%
-   Contributions to team project: 50% **(\*)**
-   Midterm exams: 30%
-   Attendance and participation: 5%

**(\*)** You must make a substantial *technical* contribution to your team software project. Although the non-technical contributions you make to your project, such as planning, communication, and organization, are important, you must also make a substantial contribution to the design and implementation of the software. I reserve the right to assign a failing grade for the course to any student who does not do this.

### Course website

Please check the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs320-spring2014/>, regularly for important announcements.

### Attendance

Class time will be devoted to activities, project work, demos, and status reports. As such, it is essential that you attend class.

If you have more than two unexcused absences, then your course grade will be reduced by a number of points equal to

> 2<sup>(<i>absences</i> - 2)</sup>

For example, if you have 5 unexcused absences, then your course grade will be reduced by 2<sup>(5-2)</sup> = 8 points.

### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments are posted on the [Reading Assignments](reading.html) page.

Because we will be using class time primarily for discussion and activities, rather than lecture, it is important that you do the reading.

### Posting and submission of assignments and labs

Assignments and labs will be posted as zip files on the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs320-spring2014/>.

Assignments will be submitted using the server <https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/>. You will receive an email containing the username and password you should use for this server.

### Academic Integrity

The college catalog states the following:

> Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of research, falsification of academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

Please refer to the college catalog for an explanation of the official college policies relating to academic integrity.

The following policy pertains to homework and graded (individual) programming assignments in this course:

> All homework assignments and graded (individual) programming assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts and strategies with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of code or other work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.) that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page. When you work on a programming assignment, it must be **your** program, not your adaptation of someone else's program.

You are allowed to (and expected to) work with the members of your team on team project(s).

Quizzes and exams must be completed individually.

Any violation of the course's academic integrity policy will be referred to the Dean of Academic Affairs, and could have consequences ranging from a 0 on an assignment to dismissal from the college.

### Late Assignments

Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than two (2) days late.**

### Exams

No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided. All exams will be open book and open notes.

### Attendance and Participation

We expect you to attend class and participate regularly in class activities. If you miss a class, please notify me in advance. You are responsible for all material covered in class, regardless of whether or not you were present. If you attend and participate in class regularly, you can expect to receive full credit for attendance and participation. Frequent absence and/or lack of participation will reduce the credit you receive for attendance and participation. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the schedule below.

### Professionalism

We expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

We reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA’s, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
